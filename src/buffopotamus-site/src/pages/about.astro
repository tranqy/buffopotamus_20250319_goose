      <h2>The Story of Biff</h2>
      <p>
        Biff is a magical creature known as a Buffopotamus - a rare and special blend of 
        buffalo and hippopotamus. Born in the enchanted meadows between the Great Plains 
        and the Magical River, Biff combines the gentle nature of both animals with a 
        curiosity and kindness all his own.

        With his distinctive purple-blue fur, small buffalo horns, and round hippo-like 
        face, Biff spends his days exploring the world, making friends with all sorts of creatures, 
        and going on exciting adventures. He loves to help others and is always ready to lend a 
        helping hoof when anyone is in trouble.

      <h2>A Day in Biff's Life</h2>
      <p>
        Biff wakes up early each morning as the sun rises over the meadow. After a refreshing 
        dip in the cool river waters, he enjoys a breakfast of fresh water plants and sweet grasses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each day brings new adventures - sometimes Biff helps the forest creatures solve problems, 
        other days he might explore a new area of his magical world, or teach the young animals 
        important life lessons. No matter what he's doing, Biff always makes time for his friends 
        and for helping others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As evening falls, Biff returns to his cozy den near the river bend, where he likes to 
        watch the stars come out before drifting off to sleep, dreaming of tomorrow's adventures.
