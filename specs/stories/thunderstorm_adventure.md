# Biff and the Great Thunderstorm

In the heart of Mixamalia, where the savanna stretched wide and the Blue Bend River flowed peacefully, storm clouds began to gather one warm afternoon. Most animals knew to find shelter when dark clouds appeared, but this storm was arriving much faster than usual.

Biff the Buffopotamus was enjoying a lazy afternoon, half-submerged in his favorite river bend, when he felt a familiar tingling in his horns. His special ability to sense coming rain was stronger than ever before.

"This isn't just any rain," Biff mumbled to himself, climbing onto the shore. "This is going to be a big storm."

He looked around and noticed many of the smaller animals still playing, unaware of the danger approaching. Even some of the larger animals hadn't noticed the dark clouds gathering on the horizon.

## The Warning

"Friends!" Biff called out, his voice booming across the savanna. "A big storm is coming! Everyone needs to find shelter!"

The gazelles, who trusted Biff's weather predictions, immediately bounded away to their sheltered valleys. The elephants trumpeted the warning further across the plains. But some animals were too far away to hear.

"I need to warn the others," Biff decided, setting off at a quick trot that made his round belly bounce.

He headed first to Turtle Pond, where the tortoise elders were having their weekly meeting. Being slow movers, they would need the most time to reach safety.

"Elder Shells," Biff said respectfully, approaching the circle of ancient tortoises. "My horns tell me a mighty storm approaches. You might want to head to higher ground."

"Bah! We've survived many storms," said Elder Hardback, the oldest tortoise. "We'll just tuck into our shells."

Biff shook his shaggy head. "Not this storm. My horns have never tingled this strongly before. The river might flood its banks."

## The Plan

After convincing the tortoises to begin their slow journey to higher ground, Biff rushed to warn others. He splashed through streams to alert the fish families, galloped across meadows to warn the burrowing creatures, and even climbed partway up a hill to make sure the mountain goats knew to secure their ledges.

By the time he reached the far side of the savanna, the wind had picked up significantly. Leaves and small branches whipped through the air, and the first heavy raindrops began to fall.

Biff spotted a family of prairie dogs still outside their burrow, gathering last-minute seeds.

"Hurry!" he called to them. "Get inside now!"

Just as the last prairie dog disappeared into the safety of its burrow, a tremendous lightning bolt struck a nearby tree, splitting it with an enormous CRACK!

The tree began to fall – directly toward the prairie dog burrow entrance!

## The Rescue

Without hesitation, Biff charged forward. Using all the strength from his buffalo side, he lowered his head and caught the falling tree on his small but sturdy horns. The weight was tremendous, and Biff's legs trembled with the effort, but his hippo side gave him the stability he needed to hold firm.

"Dig a side exit!" he called to the prairie dogs, his voice strained. "I can't hold this forever!"

The rain poured down in sheets now, making the ground muddy and Biff's task even harder. But the prairie dogs were expert diggers. Working together frantically, they tunneled a new exit on the opposite side of their burrow mound.

"We're through!" came a squeaky voice after what seemed like forever to Biff.

One by one, the prairie dog family escaped through their new exit. Once the last one was safely out, Biff carefully lowered the tree the rest of the way to the ground, his muscles aching from the effort.

## The Shelter

The storm was now at full force. Lightning flashed across the sky, thunder boomed so loudly it shook the ground, and the rain came down in blinding sheets.

"Follow me!" Biff shouted to the prairie dogs over the howling wind. "I know a safe place!"

Leading the way, Biff guided the prairie dog family to a large rock overhang he had discovered during his explorations. Several other animals had already taken shelter there – rabbits, a young antelope, and even a normally solitary leopard who was too concerned with staying dry to think about hunting.

Biff's thick, shaggy coat was soaked through, but his buffalo heritage kept him warm even when wet. He settled down at the entrance of the shelter, using his large body to block the worst of the wind and rain from reaching the other animals.

## The Wait

For hours, the storm raged. The younger animals were frightened by the thunder, so Biff began telling them stories about the friendly cloud spirits who were just having a loud conversation. His deep, gentle voice soothed their fears, and soon even the leopard was listening attentively.

"My grandma hippo used to say that thunder is just the sky's way of reminding us to appreciate the quiet," Biff shared, as another boom echoed across the savanna.

By nightfall, the storm began to subside. The thunder became more distant, the lightning less frequent, and the rain softened to a gentle patter.

## The New Day

When morning came, the animals emerged from their shelter to find the savanna transformed. Small streams had appeared where there had been only dry earth before. Fallen branches littered the ground, and the Blue Bend River had indeed risen just as Biff had predicted.

But thanks to Biff's warning, all the animals had found safe shelter. Even the tortoise elders had reached higher ground in time, though they would never admit how grateful they were for the early warning.

As the sun broke through the remaining clouds, a beautiful rainbow stretched across the sky. The animals gathered around Biff, thanking him for his help.

"I just did what anyone would do," Biff said modestly, his big eyes reflecting the rainbow colors.

"Not anyone could have held up that tree," said the prairie dog mother. "Or known the storm was coming before it arrived."

Biff smiled, feeling a warm glow inside that matched the sunshine now drying his shaggy coat. Being a buffopotamus – not quite a buffalo, not quite a hippopotamus – gave him unique abilities that had helped his friends.

As he headed back to his den for a well-deserved rest, Biff the Buffopotamus decided that weathering storms was much easier when everyone worked together, regardless of their differences.

And somewhere deep in his heart, he knew that there would be many more adventures to come in the magical land of Mixamalia.
